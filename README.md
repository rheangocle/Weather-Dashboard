## Criteria
With the weather dashboard, when the user loads the page, they will be able to search for a city. After clicking submit, the user will be presented with the current weather for the city, including temperature (in Fahrenheit), humidity, wind speed, and UV Index. The UV index value will have a color indicator showing whether the conditions are low, moderate, high, very high, or extreme risk. The user will also be presented with the five day forecast for the city. The last city search will show up underneath the search bar as a button that the user can click on to view the weather. Every city search will populate in the search history as a button that the user can click on to view the current and five day forecast.
